 # Mintbase Grant Proposal
 **Project Name:** "Dimension Marketplace"

**Team Name:** Dimension

**Payment Address**: 

**Level:** 2
  

## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 

### Overview
**A tag line:**  NFT marketplace 18+

**Project description:**  

This project was born with the intent to bring together the community of architects, designers and makers from all around the world and help them sell their designs, 2D & 3D assets and 
technical drawings as NFTs at a global price point.
We already have a web3 community of 200 plus members that comprise of  architects, artists and designers from our existing network of audience of 200K+ members

  

**Goal:**

To create an NFT Marketplace to buy and sell spatial design elements to empower web2 design communities to sell their designs to the global marketplace using web3 focused on
Real world design IPs via NFTs (Eg - Furniture designs, technical drawings)
Metaverse based designs (Eg - 3D assets for metaverse, virtual spaces, avatars)
  

Here is the intended flow:
1) Any designer can upload their 2D/3D assets to the marketplace, create an NFT for them, and list the item there.
2) Anyone who is interested can visit the marketplace and purchase the NFT for the asset they desired to download.
3) The content will be made available for download once the NFT has been acquired.

  
  

**An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem:**

The reason this project links to Mintbase and the NEAR ecosystem is that we are attempting to onboard more than 200k users into Web3 utilising NEAR's Web Wallet,
which facilitates the onboarding process and permits more spatial designers into Web3, with the assistance of Mintbase. 

**An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project:**


We are interested because we see how many creators are at the mercy of centralised platforms to distribute their content. The goal is to provide open source tools to support all creators, starting with one special creator.


### Project Details:

**Technology stack:**
- Backend:
	- MongoDB

	- AWS S3 (For downloadable content storage (2D/3D assets. Using centralised storage for now because of the file size limits with Mintbase)

	- Express.js

	- Node.js

	- Near javascript-sdk (for smart contract)
  
- Frontend:

	- React
	
	- Tailwind CSS

### Ecosystem Fit

**Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?**
	Right on top of Mintbase (as well as other Dapps hopefully). As people learn about Mintbase and the tools offered in the Mintbase toolkit, we hope that content creators looking for more delicate handling of their projects will look at this project.


**Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's user base, yourself)?**

Target audience is generally NSFW content creators to spin up and use our contracts as well as consumers of the content who will be collecting NFTs.

We also hope to integrate with various chains to ensure that funds can reach intended creators from any chain.

**What need(s) does your project meet?**
The need for open source web3 tools that support NSFW content creators.

**If so, how is your project different?**

Our project hopes to focus specifically on the sensitive nature of NSFW content creation and aims to focus on helping these creators use web3 tools to create self-sustaining economies for themselves.

 **If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?**
 Not that we have seen so far.

## Development Status:

Our project is still in its infancy. Since this initiative is a novel idea for this chain, we were unable to find anything comparable. Better thought out and developed requirements are required.

Given that it is a novel idea, the growth of this marketplace is complicated. The project must first be developed and designed. After that, the required infrastructure must be installed.
Once the market is operational, it needs to be adequately promoted to potential customers. All of these procedures must be followed to ensure success.
